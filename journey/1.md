## What is this?

This is where I will note down stuff that comes to mind during the development of this blogging website. My plan is to turn this into an actual blog post once the project is complete.

## About the project

Well, the project is a simple blogging website for personal use. I was starting to develop real web development projects and thought a blogging site would be the best one to start. It will not only help me regularly write down my development journey but also will be relatively easy so that I can learn how an actual project should be designed, developed, and deployed.

## The beginning

First, I created a directory called `Blog` and created a new react project using Create-React-App with the name `blog-site`.
I initialized a git in `Blog` and committed all changes.

### Tiptap

Now the first thing I decided to do is to experiment with a rich text editor. I found a lot of options but chose to go with [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/), as it offers a lot of customizability and all the essential features I want. I installed TipTap and started to try out different things I could do with it. I used the `StarterKit` first and then installed the `extension-image` for supporting images.

### Tiptap Images

The `extension-image` extension from tiptap is fundamental. It does not support ways to change the size of images, which is a feature I want in the editor. But fortunately, they provide ways to extend the extensions to fit our needs. I followed a blog post on [adding functionalities to image extension](https://aboutweb.dev/blog/tiptap2-vue3-extending-image-functionality/) to add the features I wanted. The blog is written for Vue, but I am confident I can use that as a base for React.

I made a button to create an image, and a BubbleMenu to change the size of the menu to either 'small', 'medium', 'large'. Currently the editor is very basic but I can easily implement more features to it in the coming days. I committed all progress
